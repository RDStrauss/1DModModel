# 1DModModel
1D cosmic ray transport model from Moraal and co-workers, ca 1980 translated into Python3.

## Model details

The FORTRAN version of the 1D cosmic ray modulation model of Caballero-Lopez & Moraal (2004) is translated into Python3. The model can be run from the command line:

(base) fskrdts@fskrdts/Test_3 - Moraal comparison$ python Moraal_model.py 

This just the basic model. More details and user-friendly edits will be done in the coming months.
